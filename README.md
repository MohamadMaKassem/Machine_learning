Got it! Since you're using **PyTorch** and you're collaborating through a **common GitHub repository**, let's adjust the approach accordingly.

### **Steps to Save, Share, and Load the PyTorch Model**

---

### **1. Save Your PyTorch Model**

After training your model in PyTorch, save the model's state dictionary (which contains the parameters of the model) and the model's architecture if needed.

#### **Saving the Model**:
```python
import torch

# Assuming `model` is your trained PyTorch model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), '/content/Machine_learning/trained_model.pth')
```

This saves only the model's parameters, not the model architecture itself. If you want to save both the model architecture and parameters, you can save the entire model:

```python
torch.save(model, '/content/Machine_learning/trained_model_full.pth')
```

However, it's generally recommended to save the **state_dict** for flexibility (especially if you need to change the architecture later).

---

### **2. Upload the Model to GitHub**

Once you have saved the model file (`trained_model.pth` or `trained_model_full.pth`), you can push it to your shared GitHub repository.

#### **Steps to Push the Model to GitHub**:
1. Navigate to your repository directory in Colab:
   ```python
   %cd /content/Machine_learning
   ```

2. Add the model file to Git:
   ```python
   !git add trained_model.pth  # Or use the full model file name
   ```

3. Commit the model file:
   ```python
   !git commit -m "Add trained PyTorch model"
   ```

4. Push the model to GitHub:
   ```python
   !git push origin main
   ```

---

### **3. Haidar Accessing the Model from GitHub**

Haidar can clone the repository to get access to the model file:

#### **Cloning the Repository**:
```python
!git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
%cd your-repo
```

After cloning, he will find the `trained_model.pth` file in the repository directory.

---

### **4. Loading the Model in a New Colab Session**

Once the model file is pushed to GitHub, both you and Haidar can load the model in any Colab notebook by first cloning the repository (if not already done) and then loading the model.

#### **Steps to Load the Model**:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```python
   !git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   %cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Load the Model**:
   ```python
   import torch
   model = TheModelClass()  # Define the model class or load the model architecture
   model.load_state_dict(torch.load('trained_model.pth'))  # Load the saved parameters
   model.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode
   ```

   If you saved the **full model** (not just `state_dict`), you can load it directly:
   ```python
   model = torch.load('trained_model_full.pth')
   model.eval()
   ```

---

### **5. Collaborating with Multiple Versions**
If you and Haidar are experimenting with different versions of the model, it's a good idea to **version** the model files by adding version numbers in the file names:

- `trained_model_v1.pth`
- `trained_model_v2.pth`

This way, you can easily track and load different versions of the model.

---

### **6. Avoid Large Model Files in GitHub (Optional)**
If your model file is too large (GitHub has a 100 MB limit for individual files), you can use **Git LFS** (Git Large File Storage) or store the model on **Google Drive** and share the link in your GitHub repo.

For Git LFS, you would:
1. Install and set up Git LFS on your machine.
2. Track the model file using:
   ```bash
   git lfs track "*.pth"
   ```

This will allow you to upload larger model files to GitHub.

---

### **Summary**

1. **Save your PyTorch model** using `torch.save()`.
2. **Push the saved model** to your GitHub repository.
3. **Clone and load the model** in any Colab session using `torch.load()`.
4. **Collaborate** by versioning model files or using Google Drive for very large models.

This process ensures both you and Haidar can easily access, test, and continue working with the same trained model without retraining.
